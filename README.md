This github is a general working version of the comparison of Light injection and Bismuth 207 calibration.
Each folder has his own CMakelist and sources files so you need to build in this way:
First corr_OM_ref (= reference OM)
Then Li (= Light Injection)
Bi (= Bismuth 207 calibration)
Finally comparison_Bi_Li
```
